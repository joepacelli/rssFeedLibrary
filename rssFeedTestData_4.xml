      <title>Backstage Premiere: RUN HIDE FIGHT </title>
      <description>Join Ben Shapiro, Jeremy Boreing, and the rest of the Backstage crew and special guests as Daily Wire makes its entrance into entertainment content with its first feature film, RUN HIDE FIGHT.

Starring Isabel May, Thomas Jane, Radha Mitchell, RUN HIDE FIGHT follows a high school sieged by a quartet of school shooters. Zoe Hull (Isabel May) is a high school student coping with the recent loss of her mother. All she wants is to get through the last few weeks of her senior year and leave — off to college and a fresh start. Instead, her high school is attacked by four nihilistic, gun-toting students, who plan to make their siege the worst school shooting in history. Using her wits and survival skills, Zoe fights back to save herself and her fellow students. 

AUDIENCE WARNING: This video is rated TV-MA for violence, language, and nudity and is intended only for mature audiences.

RUN HIDE FIGHT will be available for streaming on Dailywire.com after our live stream premiere — exclusively for Daily Wire members.</description>

      <title>J.D. Vance | The Ben Shapiro Show Sunday Special Ep. 109</title>
      <description>Four years ago, Hillbilly Elegy was a well regarded memoir, now, with its 2020 Netflix adaptation, the work has become critically panned and the subject of endless controversy. The author, J.D. Vance, wrote about his upbringing in the Appalachian regions of Kentucky and Middletown, Ohio. A look into the history and values in this area of the country, it was recommended by mainstream outlets and cultural leaders in mass for insight into the plights of the white working class that impacted the 2016 election. That praise was short lived, however, when the nearly unanimous edict came down from the media that the trials of impoverished white Americans were insignificant and should be ignored. J.D. joins the show to discuss the book, the media’s harsh shift, and how conservatives can connect with the Appalachian and Rust Belt regions of the country moving forward.

      <title>Abigail Shrier | The Ben Shapiro Show Sunday Special Ep. 108</title>
      <description>Based on a single tweet crying transphobia, Target pulled a book from their shelves nationwide. Abigail Shrier, the author of that book, joins the show today. “Irreversible Damage: The Transgender Craze Seducing Our Daughters” explores the alarming new trend of teens self-diagnosing themselves with rapid onset gender dysphoria. A condition that was relatively rare and generally only seen among young boys, has now skyrocketed in young girls. The problem wouldn’t be as profound, however, if it weren’t for the medical, scientific, and education establishment that has completely surrendered to woke activists, and now actively enable and encourage young people to irreversibly damage their bodies and compromise their futures. 

Abigail joins the show to discuss her book, the struggles she has faces with spreading her message, and if conservatives and common sense liberals can ever have unity enough to find a solution.

      <title>Tim Pool | The Ben Shapiro Show Sunday Special Ep. 107</title>
      <description>As the legacy media continues to display overt political bias and seek to deceive the American people, the public has begun to turn to members of the replacement media who seek and speak the truth without covert bias. One of the most popular voices to arise from this public demand is our guest today, journalist, commentator, and youtuber, Tim Pool. Once an on-the-ground reporter in conflict zones around the world, Tim has found new traction with his work exposing the malfeasance of Antifa, the radical left, and the media that continue to cover for them. Tim joins the show today to discuss his journalist work against a media more concerned with their political agenda than the truth, as well as what the future may hold for that fight under a new administration.

      <title>Victor Davis Hanson | The Ben Shapiro Show Sunday Special Ep. 106</title>
      <description>In the wake of the 2020 election, many Americans are left searching for answers, and for any kind of sign as to what the future holds. Our guest today will hopefully be able to bring some insights to the questions that loom over us all. Dr. Victor Davis Hanson, Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution, pundit, renowned classicist and military historian, has studied enough history to have some ideas of what might come next. Where will the Republican party go from here, and what could the next four years look like for conservatives with the strong likelihood of an incoming Biden administration? Professor Hanson and I discuss all this and more.

      <title>Shelby Steele | The Ben Shapiro Show Sunday Special Ep. 105</title>
      <description>Author, columnist, and documentarian Shelby Steele has been a leading scholar on race in the nation for decades. A strong advocate for the civil rights movement of the 1960s, Steele promotes individual liberty and freedom. However, modern racial movements and policies, he says, have done more harm than good for the cause of equality. Increasing dependence on the government has undermined the cause of liberty. Steele, along with his son Eli, have recently released a new documentary, “What Killed Michael Brown?”, an investigation into the 2014 Ferguson, Missouri shooting, just as George Floyd’s death rocked the nation. The film has been labeled as controversial in some unexpected ways. Shelby joined the show today to share the full story, as well as discuss the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement and organization, and the reason President Trump and his supporters are so often labeled as racist.

      <title>Daily Wire Backstage: Jeremy Said This Debate Wouldn’t Happen Edition</title>
      <description>Will this showdown be the cakewalk for Trump that many predict? Did Biden use the vast amount of time he’s spent avoiding the press to actually debate prep or was he just napping? Do Trump’s tax returns or Hunter Biden’s shady Russian dealings have any real effect on persuading voters? Is there any chance Joe will show up to all three debates?

Join this roundtable discussion featuring Ben Shapiro, Andrew Klavan, Michael Knowles, and Daily Wire god-king Jeremy Boreing, as they get to the bottom of these questions and more.

      <title>Matthew Yglesias | The Ben Shapiro Show Sunday Special Ep. 99</title>
      <description>Joining the show this week is Vox co-founder, blogger, and host of the popular political podcast “The Weeds”, Matthew Yglesias. Having written for such publications as The Atlantic and Slate, Yglesias went on to found the immensely popular site Vox along with journalist Ezra Klein. His new book “One Billion Americans: The Case For Thinking Bigger”, presents a new and somewhat unorthodox solution to many of the problems facing our nation. We discuss his new book, his experience at Vox, as well as the controversy he found himself in when taking a recent stand against cancel culture.

      <title>The Truth About America: Where Do We Go From Here?</title>
      <description>The truth about America has been obscured and deleted by the far American Left. In this collection of Sunday Special highlights, featured guests including Tucker Carlson, Nikki Haley, and Mark Levin break down the truth about America's history, philosophy and culture. We discuss how we got to this point - and where we go from here if we want to take back the country. 
 
The topics in this video are also covered extensively in my new book, "How To Destroy America in Three Easy Steps." It's crushing sales records and coming in at the top of every bestseller chart, so if you want an antidote to divisive books like "White Fragility" and "How To Be An Antiracist," pick up your copy here: https://utm.io/uHcC

      <description>Restrictions ease across the globe as the world holds its breath; the media remain as frivolous as ever – and so do our politicians; and we examine what it’s like to have a baby in a time of coronavirus.

Check out The Cold War: What We Saw, a new podcast written and presented by Bill Whittle at https://bit.ly/2z2j1NB. In Part 1 we peel back the layers of mystery cloaking the Terror state run by the Kremlin, and watch as America takes its first small steps onto the stage of world leadership.

      <description>The Berlin Airlift. The Korean War. The Cuban Missile Crisis. The Space Race. Vietnam. Detente. Reagan. Solidarity. Gorbachev. The tales of these earth-shaking milestones have been always been told as a series of individual events, completely apart from each other. But they were not individual events; they were individual threads in the tapestry of the Apocalypse That Didn’t Happen. And because they were all part of the same ongoing story, they need to be treated that way. Check out the new 12-part podcast series, "The Cold War: What We Saw."
